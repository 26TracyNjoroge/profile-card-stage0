                Technology is constantly evolving, and that's what makes this field exciting. I believe that the best developers are those who remain adaptable and open to new ideas. Collaboration and communication are just as important as technical skills.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Outside of coding, I try to maintain a balance by staying active through physical exercise and connecting with nature. These moments of disconnection often lead to the best problem-solving insights when I return to my work.
